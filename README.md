# Sampling-based-Planning-Algorithms
In recent times, sampling-based algorithms have
been employed extensively in a high dimensional space and are
also shown to work well. Besides they are proven to be
probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. One
such algorithm that has recently become abundantly popular
in the path planning fraternity is Rapidly-exploring Random
Tree star (RRT*). In this project, we explore RRT*-Quick as
an improved version of RRT*. RRT*-Quick embarks on the
observation that the nodes in a local region have common
parents. It is shown to have a faster convergence rate without
being computationally inefficient by using ancestor nodes to
grow the reservoir of candidate parent nodes.
